trying w/o filtering 5/22B HN3 removed 5 spikes from both sides but deleted nothing:
ampL = 0.10216
STD = 0.60979
ampR = 0.1164
STD = 0.58026
# spikes = 445
# removed = 110

after filtering:
ampL = 0.10239
STD = 0.60446
ampR = 0.11621
STD = 0.57344
# spikes = 445
# removed = 110

Changes:
ampL = -0.22%
ampR = 0.11621/0.1164 = -0.16%

ampLSTD = 0.60446/0.60979 = -0.87%
ampRSTD = 0.57344/0.58026 = -1.17%

Overall, amplitudes got insignificantly smaller, and so did
STDs. Filtering was totally useless.

=> BUT, that's because Mike was already aligning traces by subtracting
the value at presynaptic spike time.

Adding a new checkbox to disable that reduced the STD:
ampL = 0.10239
STD = 0.46414
ampR = 0.11621
STD = 0.40003

Change amount:
ampL = -0.22%
ampR = +0.16%
ampLSTD = (0.46414 - 0.60979)/0.60979 = -23.88%
ampRSTD = (0.40003 - 0.58026)/0.58026 = -31.06%

=> removed some traces that had spikes around 180 ms
ampL = 0.11083
STD = 0.47444
ampR = 0.11935
STD = 0.41873

Increased amplitudes, but also the STDs. STDs increase probably
because of reduced data. One can also just display standard error.

=> Kept all spikes at start and end to increase amount of data used;
but ended up reducing amplitudes:

ampL = 0.081223 +/- 0.42
ampR = 0.08 +/- 0.36

=> Angela removes 7 spikes from both sides

ampL = 0.11183 +/- 0.46855
ampR = 0.12437 +/- 0.41445
