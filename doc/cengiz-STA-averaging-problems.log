trying w/o filtering 5/22B HN3 removed 5 spikes from both sides but deleted nothing:
ampL = 0.10216
STD = 0.60979
ampR = 0.1164
STD = 0.58026
# spikes = 445
# removed = 110

after filtering:
ampL = 0.10239
STD = 0.60446
ampR = 0.11621
STD = 0.57344
# spikes = 445
# removed = 110

Changes:
ampL = -0.22%
ampR = 0.11621/0.1164 = -0.16%

ampLSTD = 0.60446/0.60979 = -0.87%
ampRSTD = 0.57344/0.58026 = -1.17%

Overall, amplitudes got insignificantly smaller, and so did
STDs. Filtering was totally useless.
